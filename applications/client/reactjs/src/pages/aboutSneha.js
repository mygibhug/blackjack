      Thank You for visiting my profile! My name is Sneha Shrestha. I am a
      senior student majoring in Computer Science in SFSU. In this Fall 2022
      semester, for our Software Engineering class, we are making a game called
      Baby blackjack as our group project. We are a team of 6 members, and for
      this project I am working as a Front-end Developer. This is really going
      to be an exciting game, because this game has some exciting features like
      adding multiplayer. I hope you all enjoy the game our team created.
    </p>
