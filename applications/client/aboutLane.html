                Hello Everyone! I am a senior Computer Science student at San Francisco State University. I enjoy snowboarding, cooking, and hangingout with my friends and family. 
                Some of my passions include game design and mathematics, so I am eager to be apart of the Baby Blackjack Project. If you would like to get into contact with me here 
                are some of my favorite ways of being reached.
