            Thank You for visiting my profile! My name is Sneha Shrestha.
            I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science in SFSU.
            In this Fall 2022 semester, for our Software Engineering class, 
            we are making a game called Baby blackjack as our group project.
            We are a team of 6 members, and for this project I am working as a Front-end Developer.
            This is really going to be an exciting game, because this game has some exciting features like adding multiplayer.
            I hope you all enjoy the game our team created.
        </p>
